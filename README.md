# CodeWars Kotlin/Java Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various CodeWars challenges, implemented using Kotlin and/or Java programming languages. CodeWars is a website that offers programming challenges of varying difficulty levels, allowing developers to hone their skills in a fun and engaging way.

Below, is the URL to my account on CodeWars.

## Challenges

Each challenge is organized into a separate folder within the repository. Within each folder, you'll find the following files:

- **problem.md:** This file contains the original prompt for the challenge, including any sample inputs and expected outputs.
- **solution.kt or solution.java:** This file contains my implementation of the challenge, written in Kotlin or Java.

## Raising the Kyu Difficulty

As I continue to complete problems, I plan to raise Kyu difficulty to further my comfortability of it. This will allow me to push myself and improve my skills even further.

## Running the code

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have the Kotlin and/or Java development environment set up on your local machine. Once you've done that, you can simply clone the repository and run the code in your IDE of choice.

## Testing

Each solution includes a set of test cases that can be run to verify the correctness of the implementation. These tests can be run using any testing framework that's compatible with Kotlin and/or Java.
